# ⚠️ Action Required: Restart Server

To see the new **3D Brain Section**, you must restart your development server because we installed a new library (`@splinetool/react-spline`).

## How to Restart

1. Go to your terminal where `npm start` is running.
2. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it.
3. Run `npm start` again.

## What to Expect

- A loading message "Loading Simulation..." in the Digital Simulation section.
- A cool, interactive 3D scene will appear once loaded.
- You can rotate and interact with it!

## Troubleshooting

If the page is blank or the 3D scene doesn't load:
- Check the browser console (F12).
- Ensure you restarted the server.
- Verify you have a stable internet connection (it loads the model from the web).
